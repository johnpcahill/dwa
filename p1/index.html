			<h2 class="rule">Bio</h2>
			<p>I do web development at the Harvard Business School. I am taking this course for professional development.  One thing that I would like to get out of this course is to get more familiar with version control.  I've heard of git for a while and the day to day work for this course will be great practice.  I'd also like to learn more about PHP frameworks.  I have never worked with them before, but I am fairly comfortable with PHP. </p>
